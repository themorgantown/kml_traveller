Jeanette Fintz and Monika Zarzeczna.

Jeanette Fintz paintings are constructed from a vocabulary fragmented gestures gleaned from the collision and dissection if overlapping grid systems. Her working process resembles architecture, or choreography, since it employs a given methodology to discover an umpremeditated outcome. She makes editing decisions intuitively. Her paintings are therefore expressive and subjective. Constructs exist at the edge of stability, which attracts her because of the possibilities that are opened for transformation within the logical diagram. 
Monika Zarzeczna works in a space where intuition overrides control, embracing coincidence to reveal new possibilities through abstract collages, drawings, Sculptures and installations. Her work, often resembling vessels or architectural remnants explores themes of incompleteness and loss, suggesting disrupted logic and the passage of time. 

We are very pleased to be able to show Monika's sculptures with Jeanette's paintings. The interaction is nothing short of spectacular!

Harold Stevenson: Less Real Than My Routine Fantasy
 
The first institutional solo exhibition of Harold Stevenson in New York explores Stevenson's commitment to the sensual for more than five decades, and the public display of his paintings in a pre-Stonewall era. In 1966, Artforum described Stevenson as an “elegant young cowboy from Oklahoma” who became a darling among powerful figures in art and fashion for rendering armpits, belly buttons, and mouths as total environments and expanded erogenous zones.

Eddie Rodolfo Aparicio: Invernadero herido (para Huerta)

Eddie Rodolfo Aparicio premieres his first outdoor installation on the East Coast, centered around the Wardian case, a nineteenth-century device of colonial extraction that became the basis for the Crystal Palace in London. This apparatus transported living plants from Central and South America to European collectors. Aparicio's glass enclosure points to entanglements between human and nonhuman histories and lives.

Staging Area: A Barn Raising in Two Parts by Erin Besler

Part Two of Staging Area features an installation of a barn frame in the Sculpture & Architecture Park, staged as a public raising to bring together participants to collectively realize the construction process and further celebrate the barn as a site of collaboration and shared labor.

Saturday, July 19th
Curatorial Tour | Harold Stevenson: Less Real Than My Routine Fantasy 5-5:30 PM
Senior Curator Sara O’Keeffe provides a special tour of the exhibition Harold Stevenson: Less Real Than My Routine Fantasy, the first institutional solo exhibition in New York of Harold Stevenson (1929–2018). The exhibition traces forty years of Stevenson’s exploration of the human body as an environment across painting, drawing, and writing. In the pre-Stonewall era, Stevenson’s unflinching commitment to the male nude led to trouble: a jail sentence for his gallerist, Iris Clert, in 1962; his work’s removal from the Solomon R.

This group exhibition explores the convergence of body, mind, and nature. Art as concrescence - a “becoming actual” - where the multiplicity of emergence in time coheres into felt experience and physical presence. Presented in Ashley Garrett and Brian Wood’s studio, the exhibition is an interaction of work across multiple media including painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography. Primordial depth, emotional intensity, and the energetic tension between inner and outer worlds will flow between the works and into the space. 

Color, texture, and form act as conduits of energy and emotion, generating contrasts between expansive natural space and dense interior bodily sensation. Objects hang in space, surfaces roil across walls and floor. Each work is a site of resonance, where emotion, space, and matter interpenetrate and fuse—glimpses into the felt simultaneity of being at the hinged crux of present and past worlds.

"Material Girl"

Material Girl is an exhibition featuring self-identifying women artists whose work centers on the physicality of paint. Curated by artist and educator Lisa Corinne Davis and including works from Nanette Carter, Lynda Benglis, and more, the exhibition brings together a multigenerational group exploring techniques like puncturing, weaving, and dragging paint to create deeply textured, immersive surfaces. Davis and some of the artists will be in conversation at ACC at 6 PM on July 18.

On Saturday, July 19, head to Night School, Athens’s award-winning brewpub, for a live performance by Hen in the Foxhouse, the lo-fi indie project of Honduran American composer Elena Sophia Krell. Blending classical influences with dreamy urgency, her music evokes artists like Natalia LaFourcade and Philip Glass. Her new album, Look Up (2024), explores themes of memory, place, and belonging.

The concert is part of the Athens Cultural Center’s free Summer Music Series, which highlights Hudson Valley musicians across genres and generations. Youth groups from Ulster, Greene, and Columbia counties are invited to engage with artists through open sound checks and Q&As.

"And Such Small Portions!” Food and Comedy in the Catskills Resort Era

The Borscht Belt enjoys a storied history as a haven for Jewish vacationers. During much of the 20th century, Jewish families from New York’s Lower East Side, Brooklyn, and the Bronx flocked to resorts and bungalow colonies surrounded by bucolic scenery to escape the city‘s stifling summers. Symbolizing assimilation and economic security, the resorts provided an abundance of familiar foods in generous spreads―often served with comedic entertainment―that fused Eastern European Jewish traditions with American influences.

“And Such Small Portions!” explores the interplay of food and humor that happened in Borscht Belt dining rooms, kitchens, and theaters, and ultimately shaped a uniquely Jewish American culture that still thrives today.

two newly completed ground-up residences by architecture firm Büro Koray Duman (B-KD), located just 800 feet apart in Germantown, NY. Both projects reinterpret the region’s ubiquitous barn typology through a contemporary lens, offering distinct yet complementary visions of rural living.

One of the homes is a striking artist residence and studio designed for artist Miranda Fengyuan Zhang. This compact live-work space is purpose-built to integrate art, life, and landscape. Visitors will have the opportunity to step inside Zhang’s ceramic studio, observe her process, and view works in progress in a setting that blurs the boundary between interior and exterior.

The second house is composed of three pavilion-like volumes unified beneath an undulating roofline that opens to the surrounding forest. Its bold silhouette and sequence of shaded courtyards create a dynamic relationship between built form and nature, offering a serene yet expressive take on contemporary country living.

Together, these two projects highlight B-KD’s innovative approach to rethinking vernacular architecture, crafting environments that are deeply responsive to both site and purpose.

From one work to another, his pantings move between abstraction and representation, as if neither genre can fully encompass Dougherty’s desire to articulate his experience of the world. <br><br>The figurative works suggest narratives that are slippery–part story-book, part cautionary tale–and seem to straddle conscious and unconscious worlds. The abstract works are pure atmosphere–gestural, layered and open ended. His paintings feel built rather than composed—worked over, reconsidered, doubled back on until something resonates for him. <br><br>The large-scale drawings in this show are the result of multiple studies which might be made as a vehicle for generating ideas or in response to one of his existing paintings. Highly detailed and meticulous, they offer a different register, showing the hand of the artist in a medium he describes as his “mother tongue”. <br><br>What connects these works is a rigorous artistic practice, a sense of searching, and a desire to locate feeling through form.<br><br>✨ OPEN HOURS ✨⁠<br>Thursday, July 17 | 11 AM - 5 PM<br>Friday, July 18 | 11 AM - 5 PM<br>Saturday, July 19 | 10 AM - 6 PM<br>Sunday, July 20 | 11 AM - 4 PM<br>Monday, July 21 | 12 PM - 4 PM<br><br>Free and open to the public.

Luke Dougherty: Here a mist, there a mist
June 28th - July 27, 2025

An exhibition of paintings and drawings by Luke Dougherty

Luke Dougherty’s paintings feel less like declarations and more like exploratory exercises in dream, sensation and memory. From one work to another, his pantings move between abstraction and representation, as if neither genre can fully encompass Dougherty’s desire to articulate his experience of the world. 

The figurative works suggest narratives that are slippery–part story-book, part cautionary tale–and seem to straddle conscious and unconscious worlds. The abstract works are pure atmosphere–gestural, layered and open ended. His paintings feel built rather than composed—worked over, reconsidered, doubled back on until something resonates for him. 

The large-scale drawings in this show are the result of multiple studies which might be made as a vehicle for generating ideas or in response to one of his existing paintings. Highly detailed and meticulous, they offer a different register, showing the hand of the artist in a medium he describes as his “mother tongue”. 

What connects these works is a rigorous artistic practice, a sense of searching, and a desire to locate feeling through form.

Maria Camia will perform Higher Eyes on Aricama, a 45-minute solo-performance with four 4’x4’ colorful paintings / Toy Theater sets, hand puppets, costume, and a live pianist. The story follows two flower humanoids, Ari and Cama, as their attention spans shatter into infinite altered dimensions causing their homeland Aricama, the land of practice, play, and healing, to turn into dust. Will they release themselves from their attachments or lose everything they worked for? Maria explores dreams, phone addiction, and a message from the body.

July 19th we will be open extra late until 7 PM for a spring party which will include a live performance by VOLUMES at 6pm. 

VOLUMES

Volumes is a collaboration between Fawn Krieger and Anna Oxygen. The collaboration is a slow correspondence through objects, sound and group performance, with an emphasis on how live bodies and voice engage with sculptural forms and collaborative shape making.

Kikuo Saito: Reminiscence in Color
Curated by Mikiko Ino Saito

The Unknown and Its Poetics
Curated by Adrián S. Bará

This exhibition presents a group of works by international artists that live or have lived away from their home country and have been impacted by cross-cultural influences. Artists whose abstract work engages experiences and identities related to the unknown and the construction of home.

As the Italian painter Giorgio Morandi once said, “Nothing is more abstract than reality.” The group of artists included in this survey share the ability to communicate the importance of the small poetic gesture, and explore what we call reality through the language of abstraction.

With works in a range of media, this exhibition will span throughout the art center and will address relationships between cultures, languages, political systems, life under globalization, individuality and liberation.

Participating artists: Emanuel Tovar Andrade, Adrián S. Bará, Peter Brock, Tomás Díaz Cedeño, Edgar Cobián, Juan Pablo González, Ricardo González, Cynthia Gutiérrez, Elana Herzog, Melissa Joseph, Fawn Krieger, Liza Lacroix, Juliana Cerqueira Leite, Alejandro Almanza Pereda, Pepe López Reus, Juan De la Cruz Sánchez, Lucía Vidales, Michael Kelly Williams, and Liat Yossifor

Her work moves between precise abstraction and more intuitive gestures—grids of diamonds, spheres, and planar forms interrupted by moments of poured or layered paint.

"The Vessel"

An immersive, collaborative installation rooted in visual, sonic, and movement-based practices, The Vessel invites audiences into a living artwork shaped by collective gesture. Over five days, the project unfolds in a transformed creative space in Margaretville, NY, where drawings, paintings, suspended canvases, and luminous sculptures create a dynamic environment for shared exploration.

From Thursday to Sunday, all are welcome to drop in—no experience required. Visitors may draw, paint, collage, experiment, or simply observe as the installation evolves in real time. Music weaves through the space, inviting reflection and play.

On Sunday at 2pm, The Vessel culminates in a one-time interdisciplinary performance.
Longtime collaborators Gloria McLean, Michael Suchorsky, and Marshall Coid—artists with decades of international experience—premiere new works created for the event, including spontaneous improvisation in dance and music. Their contributions, together with live video by Ilona Kohlová and Alan Powell, form an immersive interplay of sound, image, and motion.

On Monday, the final form of The Vessel remains on view—a collective act of becoming.

Participating artists:

Bea Ortiz: installation, painting, drawing
Michael Suchorsky & Marshall Coid: music
Gloria McLean: dance
Ilona Kohlová & Alan Powell: video projection
Cris Ortiz: neon sculpture
Heather Craig: pop-up performances

Ambient Visions: In Common Thread

Josh Werner and Bianca Kuttickattu curate an experiential exploration of live soundscapes, interactive textures, ambient landscapes, and woven histories.

Selected paintings by Josh Werner and his live, improvised performance with noted guitarist Harvey Valdes broadcast ghostly landscapes and ambient improvisations. Werner’s abstract paintings on reclaimed paper and canvas reflect his experience as an improviser and translator for luminaries of dub, jazz, punk, and Afrofuturism.

Performance – July 17th, 7pm
Harvey Valdes and Josh Werner: Improvised Ambient Duo

The installation by Bianca Kuttickattu explores sustainability as both process and relationship. A large collage made from quilt scraps speaks to the beauty of reuse and layered histories. A second, interactive quilt invites visitors to contribute—adding their vision to a shared, evolving textile. The exhibition also features a slideshow of portraits by photographer Amit Sihag, capturing the process and artisans Namai partners with in Jaipur, India.

Jeremy Willis-Available Light-Statement

I think of these paintings as outwardly directed portraits. The
level of figuration is variable but all of the paintings depict a light
source pointed at the viewer. They interrogate self-location and
self-importance. The washes of paint nod to the sublime while
aspects of the human figure, framing devices, and elements of
trompe l’oeil expose the object nature of the painted surface;
positing the viewer in their own physicality. We observe and
perceive the sensations of illumination while the light in the room
around us remains unchanged.

Nepo Maybe, a group exhibition curated by artist Grayson Cox

“In New York, if I want to see my friends, I have to work with them.” - Grayson Cox
Nepo Maybe explores the tension between earned opportunity and social proximity—what some might call nepotism—and reimagines it as a gesture of care, reciprocity, and magnetism.
Informed by Lewis Hyde’s notion of the “gift community,” … the circulation of meaningful objects becomes a form of generosity and mutual recognition. Cox invites artists with whom he has recently shared moments of connection—some deep, others fleeting—to contribute artwork that carries personal meaning. These offerings may be small, poetic, transactional, experiential. Some are for sale, some are for giving, others are simply to be shown.
“Art must have generosity built in if it is to survive as useful,” Cox states. Nepo Maybe challenges the conventional dynamics of access and opportunity … by framing friendship and shared curiosity as valid, necessary conditions for exhibition-making.
…as much about objects as magnetic forces that bring people together—the eros between artists, between object/viewer, and between communities in need of new forms of gathering. The opening will function as a meeting ground for storytelling, exchange, and quiet witnessing.

“Eclipse (Amazon, Sept. 7, 1858),” a solo multi-channel, immersive video exhibition by acclaimed artist Janet Biggs, running from July 18 through August 17, 2025, 

The opening reception will be held on Saturday, July 19, from 3 PM to 5 PM, with the artist in attendance.

Biggs’ immersive multi-channel video installation of sights and sounds takes the viewer deep into the Amazonian rainforest, full of strangler figs and howler monkeys struggling for survival. Imagery follows the path of a total solar eclipse that occurred in 1858, one hundred years before Biggs was conceived. The installation’s videos conclude in a cloud forest, where expectations are inverted and otherworldly connections made possible. 
 
The work originates in Biggs’ memories of her mother’s struggles with Sundowning Syndrome, a symptom of dementia that interferes with the ability to distinguish day for night. After her mother’s death, Biggs began a four year journey, placing herself in multiple paths of totality as she sought to reconnect with her mother. 

Biggs embarked on a journey that conflates time and reimagines what is possible while balancing within the precarious relationship of humans to the natural world and individuals to each other.

        <description><![CDATA[Address: 4 Hudson Steet, #3, Kinderhook, NY, 12603<br>Website: https://septembergallery.com/<br>Details: SEPTEMBER presents...⁠<br><br>THE MOTHERLODE, Nicole Cherubini’s first solo exhibition at the gallery spanning twenty years of the artist’s practice. The show will respond to the gallery’s spatial distinctions while integrating three facets of her work: sculpture, photography, and performance. A central drive to Cherubini’s creativity is collaboration which will be present here in varying forms: her work with a choreographer, her re-working of photographic archives, and her integration of the influence of feminists authors, artists and theorists. Cherubini’s familiar exploration of what she terms ‘Baroque Minimalism’ runs throughout the exhibition: her baroque aesthetic is at play in the maximalist outfitting of figures in her photographs and the decadent ornamentation of her sculptures, while her minimalist inclinations are echoed in the geometric composition of her photographs and her cubed benches. Throughout the exhibition, the democratization of class and cultural signifiers, and the leveling of aesthetics and function are evidence of Cherubini’s multi-aesthetic and anti-hierarchical ethos.<br><br>Accompanying the exhibition will be an essay by Christopher Stackhouse and a publication produced with Spaces Sisters Press.

            <value><![CDATA[SEPTEMBER presents...⁠

THE MOTHERLODE, Nicole Cherubini’s first solo exhibition at the gallery spanning twenty years of the artist’s practice. The show will respond to the gallery’s spatial distinctions while integrating three facets of her work: sculpture, photography, and performance. A central drive to Cherubini’s creativity is collaboration which will be present here in varying forms: her work with a choreographer, her re-working of photographic archives, and her integration of the influence of feminists authors, artists and theorists. Cherubini’s familiar exploration of what she terms ‘Baroque Minimalism’ runs throughout the exhibition: her baroque aesthetic is at play in the maximalist outfitting of figures in her photographs and the decadent ornamentation of her sculptures, while her minimalist inclinations are echoed in the geometric composition of her photographs and her cubed benches. Throughout the exhibition, the democratization of class and cultural signifiers, and the leveling of aesthetics and function are evidence of Cherubini’s multi-aesthetic and anti-hierarchical ethos.

Accompanying the exhibition will be an essay by Christopher Stackhouse and a publication produced with Spaces Sisters Press. In addition, Cherubini and Gleich will present a reconfigured production of 46 Gordon during Upstate Art Weekend, hosted by The Campus in Hudson, NY.

Thursday, July 17, 6-8pm, we are hosting an event with Nicole Cherubini and choreographer Julia Gleich. Dancers from their collaborative movement, 46 Gordon, inspired by Virginia Woolf's, A Room of One's Own, will respond live to Cherubini's work in her solo exhibition, The Motherlode. Guests will be invited to move freely about the gallery spaces during the event, and there will be a Q&A at 7:30pm.

We will also be hosting the limited edition glass egg by Deborah Czeresko in collaboration with NOISE FOR NOW in support of abortion access.

Throughout the weekend, visitors will receive a free limited edition poster printed with Space Sisters Press for NICOLE CHERUBINI: THE MOTHERLODE.

"Jennifer Lauren Smith and Andrew Brehm In Residence"

A new climate and eco-themed arts organization in Beacon inaugurates their first artist residency with an exhibition and public performance by artists Jennifer Lauren Smith and Andrew Brehm at Scenic Hudson's River Center. Smith will showcase a series of collaged cemetery flowers gathered in Green-wood Cemetery that reflects the irony of achieving longevity through artificiality. Contextualizing the prints, Smith will also present an artist's book of large format photographs captured while wandering amongst the hillocks and mausoleums of Green-wood with her children.

Sculptor and performance artist Brehm salvages chunks of marine foam and other debris along the Hudson River to recycle into his work. Focused on cycles of use and re-use, Andrew will be utilizing the residency to build a large site-specific sculptural tableau with the processed foam, recycled paper pulp, and other found materials to create a dungeon-esque landscape of artificial stones.

Both artists share a commitment to transforming found materials into humorous works that contemplate the possibilities of stone, the future of the environment, and the quiet of the afterlife.

Reception: July 19, 5-6:30pm with a performance at 6:30pm in conjunction with The Goudy Wildlife Club.

'Unearthing the Light', an exhibition and programming that reveals and reclaims hidden histories and erasures. The exhibition brings together artworks that address the neglect and erasure of bodies because of gender, race, and poverty. It also considers the body of the earth as a site of harm as well as growth. 

The exhibition was inspired by a little-known cemetery located on prison grounds in the Hudson Valley, where girls and infants who died at the institution were buried and largely forgotten until the transmedia art project 'Incorrigibles' commemorated them last summer.

'Unearthing the Light' opens July 15th with an opening evening event Saturday, July 19th, and runs through early September. The exhibition features work by Nancy Burson, Alison Cornyn, Yolanda Cuomo, Elena del Rivero, Sandra Harper, Jillian MacDonald, Ofelia Mangen, Rita Peress, Maggie Simonelli, Diana Weymar, and Marina Zurkow, encompassing photographs, works on paper, painting, sculpture, embroidery, video, and plantworks.

Join us for transformative free programming that connects art to action: Craft seed balls to heal the earth, create photograms that capture light and shadow, and surrender to the restorative power of sound in our healing sound bath experience.

“Great Green Hope for the Urban Blues: Art and Myths of the Hudson Valley”

For over two centuries, artists have continued to portray the Hudson Valley as an earthly paradise remote from the modern world. Artists imagined the region as a promised land, an opportunity to reconnect with nature, and a space to experiment with alternative lifestyles. This myth cloaks the region’s active ties to urban tourism and trade while obscuring histories of violent settlement, enslaved labor, and resource extraction. Visit our website to see the other exhibitions on view.

Join us for two FREE public events in the galleries on July 17. 

Sound Painting | 6-7pm 
“Biography” conceived and composed by Max Reuben, developed and performed by members of the Training Company. “Biography” utilizes the gestural composing language of Soundpainting to create an ensemble-based improvised performance about a spontaneously made up person who is very, very real. 

Artist Talk | 7-8pm
Photographer Caleb Stein, Vassar class of 2017, will return to campus to discuss works from his ongoing series, “Down by the Hudson.” Works from the series are on view in two current exhibitions.

Featuring artists David Becker, John Cleater, Dan Devine, and Marie Lorenz, whose work offers a powerful commentary on the passage of time and the ever-changing nature of human existence.

Located on the banks of the Stockport Creek, where it meets the Hudson River, Twin Barns at The Staats House features two 19th-century agricultural barns thoughtfully restored and readapted by BarlisWedlick Architects. The stewardship of the 17th-century residence, which continues as a private home, will be shared with Upstate Arts Weekend to feature the work of 4 mid-career artists working across various mediums. 

In a landscape rooted in history, the artists’ work reminds us that even the most familiar can hold a hidden story, waiting to be rediscovered and reinterpreted. By transforming the functional into the representational, the work challenges us to find meaning in the most unexpected places.

Ryman’s work has long drawn inspiration from an extensive study of urban architecture, particularly attuned to the intricately converging architectural planes which compose cityscapes. Though structurally the work evades representational forms, his process is critically underpinned by successive architectonic decisions and considerations; through this framework, the work may recall elements of an architectural vocabulary, such as facades, atriums, ledges, sills, soffits, hinges, balconets, chambers, casements, and fenestrations.<br><br><br>✨ OPEN HOURS ✨⁠<br>Thursday, July 17 | 11 AM - 7 PM<br>Friday, July 18 | 11 AM - 7 PM<br>Saturday, July 19 | 11 AM - 7 PM<br>Sunday, July 20 | 11 AM - 7 PM<br>Monday, July 21 | 11 AM - 7 PM<br><br>Free and open to the public.

Ryman’s work has long drawn inspiration from an extensive study of urban architecture, particularly attuned to the intricately converging architectural planes which compose cityscapes. Though structurally the work evades representational forms, his process is critically underpinned by successive architectonic decisions and considerations; through this framework, the work may recall elements of an architectural vocabulary, such as facades, atriums, ledges, sills, soffits, hinges, balconets, chambers, casements, and fenestrations.

From the unpredictability of wild clay to the overlooked potential of poison ivy sap as lacquer, the works honor imperfection and process. As the environment shifts, this exhibition reminds us of our creative ties to the earth.

In ""Voices Unbound"", art becomes narrative. This exhibition features visual storytelling by incarcerated women, created through workshops led by Unison artists. Through drawing and storyboarding, they process experiences and reclaim their voices. Food emerges as a powerful motif—meals imagined for family, expressions of love beyond confinement. Some works trace harrowing immigration journeys through the Darién Gap and the trauma of arrival in the U.S., offering rare glimpses into resilience amid hardship.

Together, these exhibitions challenge us to see art not only as object but as survival, resistance, and renewal—rooted in place and lived experience.

“Pungent Pollen”

Curated by Kevin Umaña and including works by Ky Anderson, Caetlynn Booth, Keiko Narahashi, Sally Paul, Erika Ranee, Kate Rusek, Andy Ryan, Karlos Scarcamo, and Alex Skorija. Pungent Pollen brings together artists who challenge and reimagine traditional approaches to abstract art. Through an intuitive blend of gestural expression and geometric construction, these pieces emerge not from strict adherence to form, but from a deep, tactile relationship with materials and the act of making.

The exhibition is dispersed with intricate shapes, colors, and textures, linking abstraction with the generative beauty of pollen. Artists use the material at hand to make new life. Rejecting classical compositional hierarchies, they embrace a freer, more organic methodology—one allowing materials to guide the process as much as the hand and eye. This freedom results in works that oscillate between control and spontaneity, order and fluidity. Shapes collide, drift, or settle into unexpected harmony.

At the heart of these works is a love for materiality: rough textures, vivid pigments, translucent layers, and reclaimed surfaces. Each mark and interruption speaks to exploration and encounter, underscoring abstraction as a living, sensual, and grounded act of observation.

Its vibrant new home in the historic Everett Treadwell building in Kingston with a bold group exhibition featuring Christopher Griffith, Flowerpsycho, Re Jin Lee, and Jenny Williams—a dynamic interplay of painting, sculpture, and an immersive floral installation that pushes the edges of visual storytelling.

The opening weekend pulses with live performances: The Bones of J.R. Jones takes the stage on July 18 at 7PM, followed by Paco Cathcart (The Cradle) on July 19 at 7PM—two nights of raw, genre-defying sound to mark the start of something unforgettable.</value>

Harold Stevenson: Less Real Than My Routine Fantasy 

The first institutional solo exhibition of Harold Stevenson in New York explores Stevenson's commitment to the sensual for more than five decades, and the public display of his paintings in a pre-Stonewall era. In 1966, Artforum described Stevenson as an “elegant young cowboy from Oklahoma” who became a darling among powerful figures in art and fashion for rendering armpits, belly buttons, and mouths as total environments and expanded erogenous zones.

Eddie Rodolfo Aparicio: Invernadero herido (para Huerta)

Eddie Rodolfo Aparicio premieres his first outdoor installation on the East Coast, centered around the Wardian case, a nineteenth-century device of colonial extraction that became the basis for the Crystal Palace in London. This apparatus transported living plants from Central and South America to European collectors. Aparicio's glass enclosure points to entanglements between human and nonhuman histories and lives.

Staging Area: A Barn Raising in Two Parts by Erin Besler

Part Two of Staging Area features an installation of a barn frame in the Sculpture & Architecture Park, staged as a public raising to bring together participants to collectively realize the construction process and further celebrate the barn as a site of collaboration and shared labor.
